iPlasma_decompiled
==================

You can download the .jar files here: http://loose.upt.ro/iplasma/
(I found the URL trough this page: https://tech.commercehub.com/2016/01/19/analyzing-a-java-codebase-with-codecity-in-2016/)

Decompiled using `java-decompiler-gui-1.6.3.jar`
`lrg\insider\plugins\visualizations` contains many errors and so the project doesn't compile.


The original files are also commited, with exception of the java 5 JDK, as it weights 75Mb and is replacable by a vanilla JAVA 8 JDK. FFR, the version is displayer here:
```
iPlasma_decompiled\iPlasma\jre1502\bin\java.exe -version
java version "1.5.0_02"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_02-b09)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_02-b09, mixed mode)
```
