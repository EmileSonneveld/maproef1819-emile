Run everythin under java version: `jdk-8u221-windows-x64`

Copy `Semanticdb.scala` to `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/Semanticdb.scala`

Open `maproef1819-emile\thesisScalaProject` with IntellIJ

Fix the SBT path in `def execSbtSemanticDB`

In main.scala `def main`m you can choose what project should be analysed. The results should be printed in the console. Otherwise, the path to the project could be passed as the first afgument of this program.
The depandency `thesisCommon` should already have a good .jar commited.
